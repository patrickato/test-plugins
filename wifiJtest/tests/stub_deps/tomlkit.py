"""Minimal stub for `tomlkit`, which this dev/test environment cannot
install. pwnagotchi/utils.py imports it at module level but only calls
it from config-file read/write helpers this suite never exercises
(StatusFile and remove_whitelisted, the two things imported from
pwnagotchi.utils here, don't touch it at all) - a stub that only needs
to exist, not function, is all that's needed to load the REAL
pwnagotchi.utils module for testing."""
