WifiJtest - a rebuild of wifi_jammer.py (itsdarklikehell/pwnagotchi-plugins,
author "Deus Dust").

============================================================================
 FOR YOUR OWN AUTHORIZED HARDWARE ONLY. READ config.toml BEFORE ENABLING.
============================================================================

This plugin sends real 802.11 deauthentication frames via bettercap's
`wifi.deauth` module. It will NEVER fire against anything unless you
explicitly list that network's BSSID or SSID in `authorized_networks` in
config.toml - the list is empty by default, and an empty list means this
plugin loads but does nothing at all, ever. That allowlist is the actual
safety mechanism here, not physical signal range - WiFi frames don't
respect property lines the way line-of-sight assumptions suggest (walls,
antenna gain, and elevation all change how far a deauth frame actually
carries), so the list is what keeps this plugin from ever touching a
network you didn't name.

Original bugs fixed (see NOTES.md for the full writeup):
  FIX #1: `from pwnagotchi.plugins import BasePlugin` - BasePlugin does
          not exist anywhere in this fork (confirmed against the real
          cloned source). The plugin could never even import, let alone
          load. Rebuilt on the real `plugins.Plugin` base class.
  FIX #2: `access_point.bssid` (attribute access) - this fork's real AP
          argument is a dict (`access_point['mac']`), not an object with
          a `.bssid` attribute. Would have been an AttributeError even
          with FIX #1 alone.
  FIX #3: no authorization/scoping at all - the original fired at EVERY
          AP that ever yielded a handshake, unconditionally. Replaced
          with the authorized_networks allowlist described above.
  FIX #4: shelled out to `aireplay-ng --deauth 0` (0 = unlimited packets,
          forever) as a brand-new subprocess fighting bettercap for the
          same monitor interface. Replaced with `agent.run('wifi.deauth
          <mac>')` - the exact same in-process bettercap API call this
          fork's own core agent.py already uses for its normal deauth
          behavior (pwnagotchi/agent.py's Agent.deauth()). No new binary
          dependency, no interface-name guessing, no risk of two
          processes fighting over the same monitor interface.

What's added beyond the original's intent:
  - A per-target cooldown so an authorized target can't be hammered on
    every single association/handshake event in a tight loop.
  - Fires on `on_association` (as soon as the AP is seen/interacted
    with) in addition to `on_handshake` (the original's only trigger),
    so you don't have to wait for a full handshake capture to test
    against your own gear - both are on by default, per the "make it
    easy to use in my own lab" request this was built for.
  - A manual "fire now" webhook page for on-demand testing independent
    of any live event - visit http://pwnagotchi.local:8080/plugins/
    wifiJtest/ to see your configured MAC-form targets and fire a
    burst at any of them on demand.
  - SSID matching in addition to BSSID matching in authorized_networks,
    so you can list your own network by name instead of hunting for its
    MAC address if you don't have it handy (BSSID is still the more
    precise match - an SSID string can never be as unambiguous as a MAC
    - but for a lab you control, either is a legitimate, explicit choice
    you're making about your own hardware).
